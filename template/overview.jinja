<h1>Processing.py overview.</h1>
<p>You write Processing code. In Python.</p>

<p>Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.</p>

<p>Processing was initially released with a Java-based syntax, and with a lexicon of graphical primitives that took inspiration from OpenGL, Postscript, Design by Numbers, and other sources. With the gradual addition of alternative progamming interfaces — including <a href="http://p5js.org" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://py.processing.org">Python</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing" target="_blank">Ruby</a> — it has become increasingly clear that Processing is not a single language, but rather, an arts-oriented <em>approach</em> to learning, teaching, and making things with code.</p> 

<p>We are thrilled to make available this public release of the Python Mode for Processing, and its associated documentation. More is on the way! If you'd like to help us improve the <a href="https://github.com/jdf/processing.py" target="_blank">implementation of Python Mode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kazimuth/processing-py-site" target="_blank">its documentation</a>, please find us on Github!</p>
	
<h4>Credits</h4>

<p>Processing.py was chiefly developed by <a href="http://mrfeinberg.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Feinberg</a>, with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov. The Python Mode examples, reference, and tutorials were ported and/or created by James Gilles, Allison Parrish, and Miles Peyton. Casey Reas, Ben Fry, Daniel Shiffman, and Golan Levin provided guidance and encouragement.</p>

<p>Support for the development of Processing.py came from many sources. Jonathan Feinberg implemented Processing.py independently from July 2010 through April 2014; since then, <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> has kindly supported his efforts. In summer 2014, work on the Reference, Examples and Tutorials was funded in part by the Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/ideate/" target="_blank">IDeATe</a>) initiative at Carnegie Mellon University, and by a grant from the <a href="http://arts.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Arts</a> managed by the <a href="http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/" target="_blank">Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry</a> at CMU. The <a href="https://processing.org/foundation/" target="_blank">Processing Foundation</a> and <a href="http://fathom.info/" target="_blank">Fathom</a> have also provided critical logistical support for this work.</p>
